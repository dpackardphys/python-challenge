# python-challenge
This challenge consisted of two parts, reading in two different data sets from csv and performing different analyses on them. The results of each analysis are both printed to the terminal and exported as a text file by the scripts in each case.

## PyBank
The first was an analysis of financial data, a series of monthly profits/losses. We tallied the total number of months in the data, and we recorded the total profits, the average monthly change in profit, and the months with the greatest increase/decrease in profit (and their respective amounts).

## PyPoll
The second was an analysis of election data. We tallied the total number of votes, recorded the votes and vote percentage for each candidate, and determined the winner of the election.
